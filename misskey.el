(defun misskey/json/walk (obj key func)
  "walk plist and apply FUNC for each occurrence of KEY.
It assumes OBJ is valid plist.


Idea behind this function is coming from pandoc library in Haskell.
Its document might helps you to understand concept of it:
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-types-1.22.2.1/docs/Text-Pandoc-Walk.html


* Examples

```

			 :renote (:id 1 :createdAt  \"2022-01-01T12:30:10.00Z\"))
		   :createdAt '(lambda (d) (iso8601-parse d)))
>> (:id 0 :createdAt (10 30 12 1 1 2022 nil nil 0) :renote (:id 1 :createdAt (10 30 12 1 1 2022 nil nil 0)))

PATH is symbol of API endpoint path, such as users/show or users/notes.

If API endpoint requires authentication, set CREDENTIAL non-nil.

REQUIRED-PARAMS represents list of required parameters and their validators.
There're two way to specify parameters: simple list or list following `anyOf'.

If endpoint requires all of given params, use simple list. If endpoint requires
one or more of given params (which is represented as 'anyOf' in misskey spec),
use `anyOf' followed by list.

Either case, element of list are (PARAMETER-NAME . VALIDATOR).

OPTIONAL-PARAMS represents list of optional parameters and their validators.
Optional parameters are defined as \"keyword arguments\" by using `cl-defun'.
Unlike REQUIRED-PARAMS, it is simple list, and element of list are
(PARAMETER-NAME . VALIDATOR). PARAMETER-NAME is directly used as keyword argument,
 so _do not_ make it keyword (by start with \":\").
